<H3>Introduction</H3>
<p>This is the Public Application Programming Interface of Plealog Bioinformatics Filter software.</p>

<H3>What is a filter?</H3>
<p>A filter is made of some rules, each of them being on constraint applied on the data contains in a BLAST result file. This
library is capable of reading legacy NCBI XML file (-outfmt 5 argument from BLAST+; -m 7 for legacy BLAST) and creating an object-based
data model in memory. This model lets you access the many data fields (Hit ID, alignment length, e-value, scores, etc.) of a BLAST result.
So, you use a filter to select relevant hits using your own constraints.</p>

<H3>How to use it? (... for the developers)</H3>
<p>This is a library, so its primary purpose is to provide you with a way of programming your own tools relying on the library.</p>
<p>Simply have a look at the test code, TestFilterSystem.java, located in the test package. There, you'll see how to read
an NCBI XML result file, filter it and save results in a new file.</p>

<H3>How to use it? (... for the end-users)</H3>
<p>Now, for the end users, I have setup the <a href="">BLAST Filter Tool</a> providing a very easy-to-use command line software. 
Please, have a look at <a href="">this project</>.</p>
